    "word": "Almost",
    "description": "To sign almost, hold both hands up in front of your body, palms facing up and fingers held together on each hand. Then, while keeping the non-dominant hand steady, flick your dominant hand upward while touching the fingers of the steady, non-dominant hand once.\nFlick the fingers of your non-dominant hand gently, barely touching them in fact, as if to indicate that you barely missed something, or you \"almost\" did it, but not quite."
