    "word": "Afraid, Scared, Frightened",
    "description": "Afraid starts with your open hands (or closed fists) by your sides, with the dominant hand around chest level and the non-dominant hand around stomach level. Then you bring your hands inward, in front of your body, palms facing inward and fingers spread in an open five hand.\nThe same sign is used in Baby Sign Language (and ASL) for afraid, scared, scary, and frightened. And remember, you want to look scared and frightened, so your facial expressions should match the hand signs."
