    "word": "America",
    "description": "To sign America, first open both hands and spread all fingers apart. Then bring your hands together by interlocking all fingers while keeping both thumbs sticking out, with palms open and facing your body at respective 45-degree angles. Then make a circular, gathering motion with your interlocked fingers, starting in front of your body, going around once, then ending again where they started.\nThis may remind you of the together sign, only this time, instead of fists, your hands are open and your fingers are interlocked."
