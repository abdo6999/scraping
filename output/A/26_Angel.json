    "description": "To do the baby sign for angel, begin with both open, curved hands touching each corresponding shoulder, with palms facing down and fingers together. Then pivot the curved hands outward on either side while stretching the curve to become flat, open hands. Gently flap both hands in unison, as if you were and angel opening your wings."
