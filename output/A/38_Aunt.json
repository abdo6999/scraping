    "word": "Aunt",
    "description": "To do aunt, make a fist with your thumb sticking out near your face, at top of the fist. Leading with the thumb, move your hand in a small circle near your cheek (but not touching it).\nExpect your baby to start with a much simpler version of aunt. Look for any type of fist near their cheek."
