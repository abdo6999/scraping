    "description": "To sign after, take your non-dominant hand and lay it flat in front of you. Then take your flat, open, dominant hand and make the motion of sliding it once on its pinkie side above and across the non-dominant hand, forming a noticeable arc in the process. It is as if you are in a car, starting on one end of the street, and after some time, you are on the other end.\nThis sign should not be confused with wood, where the dominant hand \"saws wood\" several times."
