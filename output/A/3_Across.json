    "word": "Across",
    "description": "The across sign uses both index fingers while each hand is drawn into a fist. Your non-dominant hand is bent at the elbow, with your index finger pointing straight ahead of you. Then your domimant hand's index finger travels forward, from touching your non-dominant index to about half a foot further ahead, indicating a short distance across something."
