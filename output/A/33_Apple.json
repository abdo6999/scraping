    "word": "Apple",
    "description": "To do the baby sign for apple, make your hand into a fist, then extend the index finger knuckle (your index finger is the one next to your thumb). Bring the knuckle to your cheek and twist it about. Imagine your cheek as an apple, and you are twisting off the stalk.\nApple is quite a complex sign, and you will see this simplified a lot at first. Often, the baby will just place their fingers on their cheek, or twist their hand near their cheek."
