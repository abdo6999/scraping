    "description": "To sign accident, as in, \"Oops! Something went wrong,\" create a letter Y sign with your dominant hand, then hold it up to your chin, palm facing you.\nTo sign accident, as in a car or other vehicular accident, create a modified number 3 sign in ASL on both hands, where your thumb, index, and middle fingers are sticking out. Hold each '3' hand sideways, and make both hands approach each other at the center, as if there are two cards colliding. As the two \"cars\" collide, bend the index and middle fingers, suggesting car dents."
