    "word": "Alarm",
    "description": "Alarm is signed by holding your non-dominant hand open, with your forearm upright, as if to suggest the face of a clock or alarm bell. Then you take your dominant hand in a first, with thumb and index finger both pointing up. The dominant hand strikes the non-dominant hand several times.\nAlarm looks like the opposite of bell, where the pointer finger is facing downward, as the clapper or tongue of a bell usually does, whereas with alarm, the pointer finger or \"clapper\" is facing up."
