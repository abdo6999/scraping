    "word": "Always",
    "description": "The always sign is signed almost like fan, but the difference is in how high you make the sign relative to your head: To sign always, form your dominant hand into a fist with your index finger sticking up. Position this hand at the level of your face or forehead, making small circles, like something in the air going round and round.\nIf you want to sign fan, you would have to make the same motion but higher above your head."
