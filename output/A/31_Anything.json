    "word": "Anything",
    "description": "Anything is a compound sign, combining the signs for any and thing. First, form the ASL letter 'A' sign with both hands aligned in front of you, each lying on the pinkie side of the fist and sticking the thumb out, with the non-dominant hand positioned lower than the dominant one in front of your body.\nThen keeping your non-dominant 'A' fist in place, motion your dominant 'A' hand downward about half a foot's distance until it disappears behind your other hand - making the sign for any. Next, form both hands as open curved hands with thumbs sticking out, held side by side in front of your body, fingertips facing the opposite hand, then move the curved hands sideways and apart."
