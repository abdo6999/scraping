    "word": "All Gone",
    "description": "All gone begins with your dominant hand open and palm facing inward. Your non-dominant hand lies open and flat to form a base with your palm facing the sky. You perform the sign by moving your dominant hand forward, away from you, while clenching your first.\nThe motion is similar to clearing a table, as if you were taking everything off the surface so that the contents are all gone."
