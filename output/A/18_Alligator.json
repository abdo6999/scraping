    "word": "Alligator",
    "description": "Alligator is signed by taking both open hands and chomping them together - opening and closing like the jaws of an alligator. For added effect, extend both arms as if they're the long jaws, and curve your fingers so they look like sharp alligator teeth, before you chomp them together.\nAs with all the animal signs, adding some sound effects and a bit of vaudeville acting help make the signs more fun and more memorable for your baby."
