    "word": "Airplane",
    "description": "To sign airplane, take your outstretched hand, and tuck in your middle and ring fingers. Then move your hand away from your body a short distance, as if flying, bobbing it back and forth a couple of times. If you move your hand a bit further up and out, slightly above your head, that's already the sign for fly.\nTucking in those two fingers is often difficult for an infant, and you will often see airplane simplified with either all four fingers tucked in, or with all fingers outstretched."
