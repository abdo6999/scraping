    "description": "Ambulance is signed by taking a half-open 'C'-shaped dominant hand and rotating it above your head. The motion should look like the rotating lights on top of an ambulance.  An alternative sign for ambulance is to take both hands in a half-open 'C' shape and rotate them above the head."
