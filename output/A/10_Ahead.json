    "word": "Ahead",
    "description": "To sign ahead, begin by making fists with both hands and bringing them together, fist to fist, with thumbs sticking up. Then keep your non-dominant fist in place as your dominant fist moves away, in a half-circular motion, ending up ahead of the other hand by a foot or so. It's like one car overtaking another one on the road and getting ahead."
