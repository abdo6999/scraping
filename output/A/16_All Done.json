    "description": "For all done, we usually do the ASL sign for finish/finished because it is a little simpler. You start with palms facing in, then turn the hands so that they are facing out.\nBy keeping your baby signs simple, you reduce frustration and increase the speed at which your baby can successfully imitate baby signs."
