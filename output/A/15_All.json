    "word": "All",
    "description": "To sign all, take your open, non-dominant hand, palm facing you with fingers held all together, and just hold it steady. Then do the same hand form with your open, dominant hand, but make a sweeping, circular gesture with this dominant hand, first hovering above the non-dominant hand. As it makes the circular swoop in the air, make it rest on the non-dominant hand, palm facing you as well.\nIt is as if you are making a gathering gesture to include \"all\" in your discussion."
