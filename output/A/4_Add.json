    "word": "Add",
    "description": "The add sign is signed with both hands. Hold your non-dominant hand steady, forming a flat letter O sign (with the thumb side facing you). Your open, dominant hand starts a short distance from and lower than the non-dominant hand, as it appears to scoop something as you draw all four fingers together with your thumb. Then set your dominant hand to just under your non-dominant hand, now both signing a flat 'O'."
