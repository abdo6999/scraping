    "word": "Babysitter",
    "description": "Babysitter is an advanced sign, best taught to older children as it consists of two signs, care and person, signed consecutively. First, sign care by making both hands into the ASL sign for 'K' (with the tip of your thumb between the index and middle fingers, and the pinkie and ring fingers curled). Stack the 'K' hands on top of one another and circle them in front of your body.\nThen sign person by taking both your hands with fingers outstretched and parallel, with your bent arms shoulder-width apart in front of your body, starting with your open hands at shoulder height and ending down at your waist level."
