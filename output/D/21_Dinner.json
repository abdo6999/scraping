    "word": "Dinner",
    "description": "To sign dinner, make the sign for evening by having your dominant hand travel with fingers together and palm down on top of your non-dominant hand, then complete the compound sign with the sign for eat, which is done by placing your dominant hand in front of your mouth with all fingers together.\nAn alternative ASL sign for dinner is to simply switch the order for signing eat and night or evening."
