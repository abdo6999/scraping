    "word": "Don\u2019t Like",
    "description": "To sign don\u2019t like, take your strong hand, touching your thumb and middle finger to your chest while the hand is open. Move your hand away from your chest while touching your middle finger (and ring finger) to your thumb, extending your index and pinkie fingers. As your hand continues to move away from your chest, twist your wrist down, extending all your fingers, as if you're dropping a piece of tissue into the trash can.\nThe look of utter disdain while shaking your head is optional, but fun!"
