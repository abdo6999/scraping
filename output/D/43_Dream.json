    "word": "Dream",
    "description": "To sign dream, take your dominant hand, form it into a fist with only the index finger sticking out (this looks like the ASL number 1 sign). Then bring your index in front of your head and wiggle it out and upward at an angle as you bend it intermittently into a hook shape or the ASL letter X sign.\nIt is as if you are signaling that your child's imagination will take flight in his or her dreams."
