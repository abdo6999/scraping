    "word": "Devil",
    "description": "To sign devil, form the number 3 sign with both hands as you hold each hand on either side of your temple (like the ears or horns of a mammal). Then as you pull both '3' hands down a short distance, bend the fingers that are sticking out, then repeat the gesture and motion a couple of times. Be sure to make a serious face as you sign 'devil'."
