    "word": "Delicious",
    "description": "Delicious is signed a bit like favorite or taste, and that makes sense, doesn't it?\nTo sign delicious, take your open five hand, then touch your middle finger and your thumb together at your chin. As you pull your hand away from your chin, slide your thumb down from and at an angle to your middle finger (kind of how you snap your fingers, but do the motion for 'delicious' gently and with no snapping sound)."
