    "word": "Destroy",
    "description": "To sign destroy, take both open number 5 hands and hold them on either side of your body, where one palm is facing up and the other palm is facing down. Have both open hands meet at the center such that the palms will face each other, and just as they barely bypass each other, transform both open hands into fists with their thumbs sticking out. Then pull these fists apart again, going back in the directions from which they each came.\nIt is as if the hands just came together to rip or tear something apart."
