    "word": "Day",
    "description": "Day in baby sign language looks like the sun rising over the horizon. Your non-dominant hand and arm should lie flat in front of your body. Your dominant arm starts vertically, with the elbow resting on the non-dominant hand, and your index finger extended upward while the rest of the fingers are drawn into a fist (i.e., the letter 'D' in ASL). Make the sign by sweeping your dominant hand down toward your non-dominant forearm, so your index finger traces an arc in the \"sky\", which is the area around your arms."
