    "word": "Diaper",
    "description": "Sign diaper by taking your hands and placing them down around your waist. Take your index fingers and middle finger together from each hand and tap them on your thumbs. It is like you are playing mini castanets at waist-height. Lots of people will do the sign a bit higher up on the body if necessary for your baby to see it properly."
