    "word": "Dress Up",
    "description": "The sign for dress up or wearing a costume is the same as the sign for clothes. You take both hands open and palms facing down, and brush your thumbs on your chest.  To show that you are not wearing normal clothes and that you are playing dress up, you make the motion and your body language more jaunty and up-beat."
