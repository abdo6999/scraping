    "word": "Doctor",
    "description": "To sign doctor, take your strong hand, curve it, and touch it to the inner wrist of your non-dominant hand, like you are taking a pulse. An alternative ASL sign for doctor is to form a letter 'D' with your dominant hand, then touch it to the inner wrist of your non-dominant hand.\nRarely, doctor is mistaken for again, because of the same curved, dominant hand touching the non-dominant hand. The important distinction is, while you touch your inner wrist with the dominant hand for doctor, you touch the inside of your palm with your curved hand for again."
