    "word": "Dress",
    "description": "This is the sign for dress, as in putting on clothing (not the item of clothing). To sign dress, take both hands with fingers spread, and move the hands down the front of your chest to your waist area, leading with your thumbs. The sign for dress looks a lot like you are showing off your fine Sunday dress."
