    "word": "Dance",
    "description": "Signing dance looks a bit like a pair of swinging Elvis legs on the dance floor. To make the dance sign, take your non-dominant hand and hold it out in front of you with the palm side facing up. With your dominant hand, extend your middle and index fingers like an upside down 'V' and swing them back and forth above your open palm."
