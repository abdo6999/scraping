    "word": "Duck",
    "description": "The baby sign for duck looks like a duck's beak quacking. Make the baby sign for duck by taking your index and middle fingers together and touching them to and separating them from your thumb, holding them in front of your mouth.\nRemember this sign, because a duck is twice as good as your regular bird. That is why the sign for duck is the same as the sign with bird, except with two fingers, not one."
