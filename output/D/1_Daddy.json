    "word": "Daddy",
    "description": "To sign daddy, dad, or father, make the number '5' in ASL, extending and spreading out the five fingers on your dominant hand. Then tap the thumb end of your '5' hand on your forehead.\nIf it's done right, you will look like a turkey. Another trick to help you remember daddy is that male signs are always above the nose, and female signs are below the nose - so the sign for daddy is the same as the sign for mommy, just a little higher."
