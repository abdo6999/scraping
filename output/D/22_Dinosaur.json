    "description": "To sign 'dinosaur, rest your non-dominant arm in the air with elbow bent, creating a flat surface. Take your dominant arm and rest its elbow on top of the flat of your non-dominant hand, positioned in a diagonal with the hand forming a head by putting fingers together. Move the dominant arm across the non-dominant arm as if the \"dinosaur\" was walking on the flat surface of the other arm.\nAn alternative ASL sign for dinosaur is to form the 'D' hand to signify the head of the dinosaur, then bob it along a line as if the dinosaur were walking."
