    "word": "Drill",
    "description": "To sign drill, form your non-dominant hand into a fist, with only its index finger sticking out laterally, pointing to the other side of your body. Then take your dominant hand, form it into the letter A sign, and run it left-to-right and vice-versa, right behind your other hand's index finger.\nIt is like you are sharpening a tool."
