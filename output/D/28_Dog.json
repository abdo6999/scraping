    "word": "Dog",
    "description": "Sign dog by patting your outstretched hand with fingers together on the side of your hip, just as if you were calling the dog.\nIn proper ASL, the patting of the hip is followed by bringing your hand up and clicking it or snapping your fingers. We don't do this second step with Baby Sign Language because clicking is a bit too complicated for babies."
