    "word": "Diamond",
    "description": "The diamond sign starts with your dominant hand formed into the letter D sign. Then with your non-dominant hand lying flat with palm facing down, take your 'D' hand and touch it to the ring finger of the non-dominant hand. Then wiggle it upward and away from the ring finger, as if suggesting that the diamond is bright and shimmery."
