    "word": "Demand",
    "description": "To sign demand, first, hold your non-dominant flat hand horizontally, facing out to one side of your body. Then do the ASL letter X sign or 'hook' with your dominant hand right beside your non-dominant palm, then touch your hook to your non-dominant palm as you pull both hands in simultaneously toward your body. It is like catching a fish with a hook and reeling it in."
