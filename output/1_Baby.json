    "word": "Baby",
    "description": "To do the sign for baby, cross your arms with hands facing up, one arm resting on the other while touching one elbow with the fingers from the opposite hand, as if you are cradling a baby in your arms. Then gently move your hands from side to side, as if rocking the imaginary baby in your arms."
