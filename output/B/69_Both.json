    "word": "Both",
    "description": "Both is signed by first making the number 2 hand, then pulling it down into your non-dominant hand formed in the shape of a receptacle (or a horizontal letter C hand), while drawing the index and middle fingers together at the same time the hand is entering the \"receptacle\". It is like shooting two basketballs into one hoop."
