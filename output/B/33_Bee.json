    "word": "Bee",
    "description": "Bee is a two-part ASL sign that looks like a bee landed on your cheek and you swatted it away. Start the sign with you dominant hand open, thumb and index fingers touching to make a little bee. (This first part of the bee sign is actually the letter F sign in ASL, so you can think of a bee landing on a flower.) Touch the tips of these two fingers against your cheek, then open your hand and swat past the spot on your cheek with the open hand."
