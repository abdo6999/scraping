    "word": "Boots",
    "description": "Boots is a two-part baby sign. You start by doing the sign for shoes, taking two closed fists and bumping them together. Then open your dominant hand and touch it to the inside of your non-dominant arm's elbow - as if to show that the boots come up high on your arm.\nAn alternative ASL sign for boots is to form flat 'B' hands, horizontally facing downward, and knocking them together."
