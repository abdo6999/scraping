    "word": "Bunny Rabbit",
    "description": "The bunny/rabbit sign looks like the long ears of a rabbit, twitching. Make both hands into fists and place them on top of your head, with middle and index fingers extended to make the rabbit ears. Bend and extend the middle and index fingers to the back of your head, as if to make the ears twitch.\nAn alternative ASL sign for rabbit or bunny is to just use one hand, your dominant hand, and make the index and middle fingers twitch back as you hold the rest of your fingers in a fist on one side of your head."
