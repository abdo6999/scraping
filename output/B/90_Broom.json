    "word": "Broom",
    "description": "Broom is a natural sign. Both fists close as if holding a broomstick, and you motion back and forth as in sweeping or mopping. We use the same sign for sweep.\nAn alternative sign for broom is to use both flat hands, where the non-dominant hand has the palm facing up, serving as the floor or surface, and the dominant flat hand serves as the broom, sweeping back and forth the dust on the floor."
