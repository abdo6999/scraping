    "word": "Balloon",
    "description": "The balloon sign starts with your two fists together in succession, in front of your mouth. Remember to also make the blowing sign with your mouth and cheeks, while you open up your hands and move your hands apart, as if you have an expanding balloon in your hands as you blow into it."
