    "word": "Boat",
    "description": "To sign boat, cup your hands together in a boat shape. Then move your hands up and down while extending them forward. The sign should look like a little boat bobbing along in some gentle waves.\nThis is quite difficult to sign precisely, so you will often see babies simplify that by pushing their hands together and moving them forward."
