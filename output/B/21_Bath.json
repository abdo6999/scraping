    "word": "Bath",
    "description": "Sign bath by making a fist out of your two hands with your thumbs sticking out, then moving the fists vertically up and down your chest. The sign looks a lot like someone scrubbing themselves with both hands, as if taking a very efficient bath. Just imagine you were married to an engineer, and they wanted to bathe with maximal efficiency!\nThe fist form in the sign for bath is actually the letter A sign in American Sign Language."
