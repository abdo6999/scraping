    "word": "Bedroom",
    "description": "Bedroom combines the ASL signs for bed and for box or room. You start by signing bed, bringing your two hands together with palms touching, and placing them by the side of your head as if they were a pillow. Then you sign box or room, by taking your two open hands palms facing each other and a few inches apart, and outlining the four sides of a room."
