    "description": "Body is signed just a bit like blouse. Form both hands into the ASL letter B, then starting at your shoulders, with palms facing in, bring down your 'B' hands in a semi-circle, ending at hip level with your 'B' hand palms still facing in.\nBody is distinguishable from blouse by the direction the palms face when forming the 'B' hands at the top of the body down to the hips. Also, blouse is signed from the top of the chest, whereas body is signed a bit higher, from shoulder level."
