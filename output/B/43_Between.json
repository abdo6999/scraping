    "word": "Between",
    "description": "To sign between, take your non-dominant, open, flat hand, with thumb pointing up, and hold it steady. Your open, flat, dominant hand will first touch its palm to the thumb of your non-dominant hand, then flip back and forth as the back of its fingers then rest alternately on the index finger side of your non-dominant hand. It is as if you are choosing between your thumb and your index finger.\nBetween is signed just a bit like share, but with the latter sign, the pinkie side of your dominant hand is fully touching the index side of your non-dominant hand as the dominant hand slides back and forth."
