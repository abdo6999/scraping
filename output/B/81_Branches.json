    "word": "Branches",
    "description": "To sign branches, first make the tree sign with your dominant hand and forearm, then take your non-dominant hand to form one branch (with the index finger only) or several branches (with the open 5 hand). The \"branches\" themselves are traced in the air with the finger or fingers in a kind of horizontal \"S\" pattern, going up and down and up again, like a rollercoaster ride."
