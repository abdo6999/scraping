    "word": "Bull",
    "description": "To sign bull, take your dominant hand, form the letter Y sign, and hold it up to your forehead, palm facing out. You are mimicking the horns of a bull on your forehead.\nWe also use the letter Y hand for signing cow, so don't confuse the two animals' signs. The 'Y' hand for cow is signed at the temple and using the tip of the thumb, whereas the 'Y' hand for bull is signed at the forehead, with the back of the hand touching the forehead flat."
