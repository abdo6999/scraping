    "word": "Brother",
    "description": "To sign brother, make both hands into an 'L' shape with your thumbs and index fingers extended. Hold your non-dominant 'L' hand down by your chest. Take your dominant hand and starting at the forehead, forming the tip of a baseball hat, bring the hand down to rest on your non-dominant hand, transforming it into an 'L'.\nWhen your baby is getting started, brother gets simplified a lot - often the 'L'-shaped hands will look more like fists, and your baby will often only do the motion with one hand."
