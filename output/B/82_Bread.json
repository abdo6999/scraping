    "description": "Bread in Baby Sign Language looks like you are cutting slices from a loaf of bread. Bread is signed with your non-dominant hand open and palm facing your body to make the imaginary loaf of bread. Your dominant hand makes a series of vertical cutting motions in front of the bread, as if it were a knife."
