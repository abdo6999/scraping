    "description": "Most parents use the regular sign for milk and use the dominant hand to sign it near their chest. But, if you want to indicate breast-feed more specifically, you would make the sign for give with both hands near one breast, then make the sign gesture outwardly, as if feeding a baby.\nWhen you make the sign for breastfeed near your chest, be sure to hold both give arms near one breast, so that your arms are bent, as if you are cradling a baby in your arms."
