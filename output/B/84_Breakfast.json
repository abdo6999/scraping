    "description": "Breakfast is a compound sign of both eat and morning -- and whichever sign you make first doesn't really matter as long as your baby understands them in tandem.\nEat (Food) is signed by taking your dominant hand with thumb touching your four fingers, then bringing the hand to the mouth repeatedly. The sign for morning looks like the sun rising over the horizon."
