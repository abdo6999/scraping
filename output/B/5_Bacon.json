    "word": "Bacon",
    "description": "To sign bacon, start with both hands in a fist, with the middle and the index fingers of each fist extended and touching each other. In ASL, this is the sign for the letter 'U'. Begin with the extended fingers of each hand, and touch the corresponding fingers on the opposite hand. Then move the hands apart as you wave them up and down in small, undulating waves."
