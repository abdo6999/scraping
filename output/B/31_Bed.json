    "word": "Bed",
    "description": "The baby sign for bed is well known to most of you. Put your two hands together, palm-to-palm. Then place your hands at an angle by the side of your head, and rest your cheek on your hands as if they were a pillow. An alternative ASL sign for bed is to just rest your cheek on the open palm of your dominant hand."
