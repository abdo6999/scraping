    "word": "Battery",
    "description": "Battery in ASL is signed by taking both hands and extending your bent index finger from the fist. Bump the extended index fingers from each hand against each other. It is like you are making each hand into a battery, and touching them against each other closes the circuit and charges up whatever your device or toy is.\nSome ASL users sign battery with the bent index and middle fingers on either hand, not just the bent index fingers, but both signs are correct."
