    "description": "The below sign is signed a bit like basement. Start the sign for below by taking your non-dominant hand and laying it flat and horizontal in front of your body, as if making a floor with your hand. Hold your dominant hand flat as well, with palm facing down, and move your hand in small circles under your non-dominant hand, as if you are drawing attention to the space below the \"floor\"."
