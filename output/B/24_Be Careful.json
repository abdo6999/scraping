    "word": "Be Careful",
    "description": "To sign be careful, start with both hands as a fist while extending your index and middle fingers at 90 degrees to your palm, thumbs resting at the vertex of the index and middle fingers (or in other words, make the 'K' sign in ASL with both hands). Take your dominant hand and tap it on top of your non-dominant hand to make the sign for be careful or just careful.\nAn alternative sign is to rest one 'K' hand on top of the other 'K' hand, and move both hands in circular motion away from and toward the body, like the wheel of a bicycle."
