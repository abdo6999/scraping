    "description": "Bottle in American Sign Language looks like you are outlining the shape of a bottle, starting at the base and going up to a skinny neck. Your weak hand should be open, with palm facing up to form the base. With your dominant hand, start down at the base with an open grip or 'C' hand, then move your hand up an imaginary bottle, closing your grip as you go up."
