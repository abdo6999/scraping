    "word": "Bus",
    "description": "The sign we use for bus looks like the motion of turning a big steering wheel back and forth, with your fists making the circular steering-wheel motion on either side of your torso. It is like you are driving a bus.\nThe bus sign in ASL is usually finger spelled ( B - U - S). However, for simplicity, we use this commonly improvised sign when working with young children."
