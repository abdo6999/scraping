    "word": "Bill",
    "description": "To sign bill, hold your non-dominant hand open and horizontally before you, palm facing in and thumb sticking up. Then take your dominant hand and use it to grasp your non-dominant hand, starting from the curve at the base of the thumb and sliding to the edge of the index finger. It is like you are tracing the top edge of a dollar bill."
