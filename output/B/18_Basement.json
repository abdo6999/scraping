    "description": "Start the sign for basement by taking your non-dominant hand and laying it flat and horizontal in front of your body, as if making a floor with your hand. Make your dominant hand into a fist with your thumb extended upward, and move your hand in small, horizontal circles under your non-dominant hand, as if you are drawing attention to the basement space under the floor."
