    "word": "Bell",
    "description": "Bell in ASL looks like you are striking a bell with a mallet and then the mallet is recoiling back after the strike. You take your non-dominant  hand open and stand your whole forearm up as if to make the wall of a bell. Then you take your dominant hand in a first, with thumb and index finger both pointing down. The dominant hand strikes the non-dominant hand, then goes back vibrating."
