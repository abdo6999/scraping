    "description": "Building is signed exactly like build. Place your flat, dominant hand on top of your flat, non-dominant one - with both palms facing down - and begin a repetitive upward movement in which one hand supersedes the other until both hands are right in front of your nose. The movement conveys the act of building a tower."
