    "word": "Busy",
    "description": "Sign busy by taking your non-dominant hand and laying it horizontally in front of your body. Then take your dominant hand, palm facing forward, and move it in a horizontal motion, left to right and back. An alternative ASL sign for busy uses the letter B hand instead of a flat, open palm.\nThe sign looks a little like your are blocking someone's path with a stop sign - because you are too busy."
