    "word": "Blonde",
    "description": "Blonde is signed by making your dominant 'Y'-shaped hand (i.e., the sign for 'Y' in ASL is a fist, with pinkie and thumb extended). Start with your thumb beside your head and shake your hand as you move your hand down from your head to your side. The sign looks like your are teasing your long blonde tresses."
