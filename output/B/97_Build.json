    "description": "To sign build, we will start with our hands in front of us with fingers together and palms facing downward. Place your dominant hand on top of your non-dominant and begin a repetitive movement in which one hand supersedes the other until both hands are right in front of your nose. The movement conveys the act of building a tower."
