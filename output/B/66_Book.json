    "word": "Book",
    "description": "To sign book, put your hands together, palm-to-palm. Then keeping your pinkies together, open up your hands as if opening up a book.\nThat book-opening motion is often difficult for babies, so you will see this approximated as the end of the sign with the hands apart. Or sometimes, it will just be the start of the sign, like the hands together."
