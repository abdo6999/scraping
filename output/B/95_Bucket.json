    "word": "Bucket",
    "description": "Bucket looks like you are holding the handle of a bucket. Take your open, dominant hand, fingers open and faced down, then lift it a short distance upward, curving your hand into a fist and bobbing it up and down.\nBucket is very similar to the ASL sign for bag, which is signed with the hand already in a fist as it bobs up and down on one's side."
