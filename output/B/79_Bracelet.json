    "word": "Bracelet",
    "description": "The bracelet sign is made with your dominant hand simply clasping the wrist of your non-dominant hand. Make a modified ASL letter C hand, where only your index finger and thumb are bent to form a letter 'C', then clasp your opposite wrist where you usually wear a bracelet or watch."
