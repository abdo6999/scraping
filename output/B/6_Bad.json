    "word": "Bad",
    "description": "Bad starts with your flat, open dominant hand facing you and touching your chin. Then move your hand away from your face, flipping it so it ends up with your palm facing forward.\nAs this is a warning sign, be sure to show a serious or sad face while signing, to underscore to your baby that a particular action is not good."
