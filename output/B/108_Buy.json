    "word": "Buy",
    "description": "The buy sign resembles the money sign, but with the added gesture of handing over your money to someone else. Form a modified letter O sign with your dominant hand, holding it above your non-dominant flat hand's palm facing up, then gesture forward with your dominant 'O' hand, as if handing the cashier your money to conclude a purchase."
