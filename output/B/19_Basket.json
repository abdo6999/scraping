    "word": "Basket",
    "description": "To do the sign for basket, have your open, curved hands touching with palms facing up, then move your hands out and up, as if outlining a basket.\nThe sign for basket can sometimes be confused for bowl, but the difference is in the size when you are moving your hands apart, before turning them up. For basket, the distance is bigger and the motion is flatter, as if to sign the sides of the basket. For bowl, the hands move a shorter distance apart, and the upward motion is more curved."
