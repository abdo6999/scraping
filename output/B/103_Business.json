    "word": "Business",
    "description": "Business is signed just a bit like busy, so be careful not to get the two confused. To sign business, take your non-dominant hand and, drawing it into a fist, lay it horizontally in front of your body. Then take your dominant hand, form the ASL letter B sign with your palm facing forward, and move it side to side a couple of times.\nWhile busy is signed with the non-dominant hand open and flat, facing down, the business sign has the non-dominant hand drawn into a fist."
