    "description": "The butter sign looks like you are scraping some butter on a knife onto a piece of toast. With your non-dominant hand, you make your flat palm face up. Then, taking your dominant hand with index finger and middle finger extended (to make a knife), tap or wipe down the non-dominant hand and curl the two fingers, as if spreading some butter with the knife onto the piece of bread."
