    "description": "To sign blood, first, sign red, then make a sign with both open 5 hands, as if a lot of a liquid is dripping down from a wall. Hold your non-dominant '5' hand up horizontally, palm facing you, then hold your dominant '5' hand vertically in front of the other hand and move it down, as if water was splashed onto a wall and is now dripping down."
