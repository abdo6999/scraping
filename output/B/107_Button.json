    "word": "Button",
    "description": "Button is signed by taking your thumb and index finger and tapping them together, while the middle, ring, and pinkie fingers are outstretched. In ASL, the button sign starts out as the letter 'F'. Once you have your thumb and index finger touching, tap them to center of your shirt or dress, or wherever it is to indicate where the actual buttons are that you are referring to. For example, to indicate a sleeve button, you would make the sign around your sleeve."
