    "word": "Box",
    "description": "Box in Baby Sign Language is very similar to blocks, just a little larger. You take your hands open about 20 inches apart, and outline the sides of a box, first the left and right, then the front and back, then the top and bottom.\nAn alternative ASL sign for box is to reverse the order, first holding your flat open palms facing your body, one farther than the other to signify the front and back of the box, then proceeding to sign the left and right sides of the box, around torso width apart and parallel to each other."
