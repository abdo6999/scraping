    "word": "Barber",
    "description": "The barber sign is a compound sign combining haircut and person. First, move your dominant hand to the closer side of your head and mimic cutting your hair with a pair of scissors. Then take both open, flat hands in front of your body, facing parallel to each other, and motion your hands downward simultaneously."
