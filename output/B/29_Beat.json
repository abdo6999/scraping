    "word": "Beat",
    "description": "To sign beat, first hold both hands in a fist, with the non-dominant hand resting in front of you, facing down, and the dominant hand hovering above the non-dominant one. Then flick the bent index and middle fingers of your dominant hand forward as this fist hovers over the non-dominant fist. It is as if you are telling the person you are talking to that you \"beat\" them in the game or race."
