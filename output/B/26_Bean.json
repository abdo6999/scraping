    "word": "Bean",
    "description": "Bean in ASL starts with the non-dominant hand made into a fist, with the index finger extended, as if it were a bean. The dominant hand pinches the bean with the index finger and the thumb, and it is then pulled back away from the bean. The motion with the dominant hand looks like you stringing a bean.\nAn alternative ASL sign for bean is to touch both index fingers and both thumbs together, then pull them away while pinching the air. It's like forming a diamond and then pulling the index fingers and thumbs apart."
