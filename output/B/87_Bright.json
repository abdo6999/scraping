    "word": "Bright",
    "description": "To sign bright, take your two open number 5 hands, stick the two middle fingers forward and close to each other, then draw both hands apart (as if you are drawing curtains open) at the same time wincing and turning your head to the side and slightly closing your eyes, to suggest that you cannot stand the glare of the bright sunlight coming from the window."
