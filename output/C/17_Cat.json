    "word": "Cat",
    "description": "To sign cat, with both hands pinch your thumb and index finger together by the side of each cheek, while keeping your remaining fingers straight out. As you pinch your fingers together, take them from each side of your face outward. The sign looks just like you are teasing your whiskers straight, so add a smug smile to complete the look of a self-satisfied cat!\nAn alternative ASL sign for cat is to simply use your dominant hand to do the same motion of teasing your whisker out from one cheek."
