    "word": "Caterpillar",
    "description": "The caterpillar sign looks like a little caterpillar inching along a branch. Take your non-dominant hand and lay it flat with the palm down (or in a fist). Take your index finger from your dominant hand, then inch it along the stationary non-dominant hand, while the rest of the dominant fingers are curved into a fist."
