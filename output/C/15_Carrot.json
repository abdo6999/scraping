    "word": "Carrot",
    "description": "To sign carrot, close the fist of your dominant hand with thumb outside and start it off close to your mouth, as if you are holding a carrot. Then have your fist travel from the side of your mouth to about a foot in front of you, while opening and closing the fist a couple of times. It is like doing half the sign for hotdog or baloney with only one hand, and forward from your mouth, not sideways like the two latter food signs."
