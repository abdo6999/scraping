    "word": "Chase",
    "description": "To sign chase, form the ASL letter A sign with both hands (that is, drawn into a fist with the thumb sticking out). Keeping the non-dominant 'A' hand steady, twirl the dominant 'A' fist towards the other fist, until the backs of the fingers on your dominant hand touch the base of the thumb on your other hand. It is as if one hand is chasing after the other."
