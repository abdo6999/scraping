    "description": "To sign candle, hold up your dominant hand vertically with fingers pointing toward the sky. Point your index finger from your non-dominant hand to the base of the palm of your dominant hand. Then wiggle the fingers of your dominant hand. The sign looks a little like your fingers are the flickering flame of a candle, while the non-dominant index finger is the wick."
