    "word": "Chicken",
    "description": "The sign for chicken looks a lot like a beak pecking the ground or scratching for food. To sign chicken, start with the bird sign. Take your thumb and index finger and make an open beak, while making the rest of your hand into a fist. Close the beak and bring it down to peck at the ground as represented by your other outstretched hand, palm facing up."
