    "word": "Carry",
    "description": "Carry is signed a bit like bring, so be careful not to get the two confused.\nTo sign carry, take your two flat hands, palms facing up. Motion them together from your dominant hand side to the front of your body, bobbing them up and down simultaneously three times as they approach the center. It is as if you are indicating that you are carrying something along as you walk or ride a vehicle."
