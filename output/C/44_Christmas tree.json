    "word": "Christmas tree",
    "description": "Christmas tree is a compound sign: first, sign Christmas, then sign tree. To sign Christmas, form the ASL letter C sign with your dominant hand, swoop it down in front of you, then scoop it back up until your dominant forearm is upright and your 'C' hand holds steady.\nTo make the tree sign, take your non-dominant hand and extend it flat across your body to make the ground. Then take your dominant hand and stand it up at right angles, with your fingers extended and pivoting back and forth at the wrist, like the swaying leaves and branches of a tree."
