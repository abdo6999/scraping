    "word": "Climb",
    "description": "To sign climb, just mimic climbing or bouldering. Take both hands and make the ASL letter C sign, then have each hand take turns climbing up one rung or level.\nClimb is signed just a bit like ladder, so be careful not to get the two confused. When you sign ladder, your grasp closes into a firm fist, whereas your 'C' hand stays open when you sign climb."
