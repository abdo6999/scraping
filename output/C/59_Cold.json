    "description": "To make the baby sign for cold, take both hands and make them into fists with thumbs up. Pull your upper arms into your sides, stiffen your forearms, and shake your fists back and forth. Remember to also match this sign with your facial expression of discomfort. The sign looks a lot like you are shivering."
