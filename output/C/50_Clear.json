    "word": "Clear",
    "description": "To sign clear, form two modified letter O hands, hold them together in front of you, then separate them by tracing two mirror arcs simultaneously, opening both hands into the open number 5 sign at the same time. The two arcs look like you just formed the letter 'M' in mid-air. It is like the sun rising at dawn and breaking the darkness in the sky."
