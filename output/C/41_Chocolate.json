    "word": "Chocolate",
    "description": "Chocolate is signed by making your dominant hand into a C-shape. Take your non-dominant hand and lay it flat with palm down in front of your body. Take the C-shape and move it in a circle, with the side of your thumb circling on top of the palm of your non-dominant hand. You can remember the sign, because it looks like you are stirring a pot of gooey melted chocolate (and 'C' stands for 'chocolate')."
