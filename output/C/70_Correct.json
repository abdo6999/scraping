    "word": "Correct",
    "description": "Correct is signed in several ways. To indicate that your child said or did something correctly, form both your hands into fists and only stick out your pointer fingers (like the number 1 sign). Putting your dominant fist on top of the other at an angle, point towards your child as if to point out, \"You're correct! You're right!\"\nIf you mean that something needs correcting, make the same sign as fix: form both hands into a modified letter O sign, and while having them face each other, move them back and forth alternately."
