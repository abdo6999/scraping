    "word": "Careful",
    "description": "To do the baby sign for careful, start with both hands in fist form, with your index and middle fingers extended at 90 degrees to your palms. This form is actually the 'K' sign in ASL. Take your dominant 'K' hand and tap it on top of your non-dominant 'K' hand to make the sign.\nAn alternative ASL sign for careful is to put one 'K' hand on top of the other 'K' hand, and together do a small, vertical circling motion towards your body."
