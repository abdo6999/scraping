    "description": "Chart is signed a lot like calendar, so be sure not to get the two confused. Hold your flat, non-dominant hand steady and horizontally to the side of your body. With the dominant number 4 hand, sweep down before the flat hand, dominant palm facing the other palm. Then sweep your '4' hand across the other hand again but horizontally, palms facing the same direction this time, mimicking the grid of a chart."
