    "word": "Close",
    "description": "Close is signed in the opposite sequence as open: take both flat hands, where the non-dominant palm is facing outward while the dominant palm is facing you a short distance away from the other hand. Swing your dominant hand toward the side of your non-dominant hand and pivot your dominant wrist so that both palms end up side by side and facing outward, with thumbs touching.\nThe sign looks like you are closing a door or gate."
