    "word": "Class",
    "description": "Class is signed by taking both your hands open and facing each other in a 'C' shape. Starting with your thumbs and index fingers touching, make a circle in the air, as if tracing a plate starting near your chest and ending away from your chest, with your hands having rotated at the wrists and concluding with your pinkies touching. You can remember the sign, because it looks like you are circling a whole group of people (a class)."
