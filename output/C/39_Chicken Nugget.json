    "word": "Chicken Nugget",
    "description": "To sign chicken nugget, first sign chicken by forming a small letter 'C' with the bent index finger and thumb of your dominant hand and 'pecking' on your flat, non-dominant hand, palm facing up. Complete the sign by shaping your hands into flat letter O hands that meet at the center in front of you, mimicking two small nuggets."
