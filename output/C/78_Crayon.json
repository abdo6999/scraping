    "word": "Crayon",
    "description": "Crayon is a compound sign: first, sign color, then sign pen. To sign color, take your fingers to your chin and wiggle them in place.\nTo sign pen, simply mimic writing something with a pen (or any other writing utensil) on a flat surface. Hold out your non-dominant hand flat, with your palm facing up, then pretend writing on it with your dominant hand formed as if grasping a pen."
