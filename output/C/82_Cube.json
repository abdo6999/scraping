    "description": "Cube is signed exactly like block, so it looks like you are outlining the sides of a block. You start by taking your open hands parallel and a few inches apart. Orient your hands to outline the front & back, then the left and right side, then the top and bottom of the block. The sign for box is very similar, you just keep your hands further apart because the box is bigger."
