    "word": "Corn",
    "description": "Corn in Baby Sign Language looks like you are holding a cob of corn with both open, curved hands, and munching away (sans the stream of butter dripping down your shirt). Make the sign by holding an imaginary cob of corn with both hands in front of your mouth, and nibbling along the corn with your mouth, turning your hands twice. A one-handed version (if you're carrying your baby in your other arm), is to get your pointer or index finger, hold it horizontally across your mouth, and turn it twice, again as if eating a cob of corn."
