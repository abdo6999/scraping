    "description": "Cookie, in baby sign language, looks like you are using a cookie cutter to cut out a cookie from a sheet of dough. To make the sign, take your non-dominant hand and lay it out flat with palm facing up in front of your body. Bend your fingers on your dominant hand into an open circle, then place your finger tips on your non-dominant hand and twist them back and forth, as if indicating the shape of your imaginary cookie."
