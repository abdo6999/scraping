    "word": "Cut",
    "description": "Cut looks like you are cutting something with a pair or scissors. Extend your index finger and middle finger to make the blades of the scissors (like a 'V' sign in ASL, only horizontally oriented with your hand facing your body), then close the fingers to make a cutting motion while moving your whole hand forward, or in front of your chest from right to left (if your right hand is dominant)."
