    "word": "Chance",
    "description": "The chance sign begins with your dominant hand shaped into a claw facing you, and your non-dominant hand held flat in front of you, with palm facing up. Draw your claw hand closer as it slightly swoops down in a curve, before it closes into a fist in front of your chest and above the other hand. It is as if to signify that you must grab this opportunity being presented to you."
