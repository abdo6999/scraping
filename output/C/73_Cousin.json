    "word": "Cousin",
    "description": "The cousin sign is made by making your hand into a C-shape. Place the C-hand by the side of your head and twist it back and forth.\nIn ASL proper, there are different cousin signs for male and female cousins. In Baby Sign Language, we try and keep it simple and just use this one sign."
