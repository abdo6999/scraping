    "word": "Champion",
    "description": "To sign champion, point upward with the index of your non-dominant hand, and make a cup facing downward with the bent fingers of your dominant hand (shaped like a claw). Place the \"cap\" on top of your index finger once. It is like putting a crown on the champion of a race.\nChampion is signed a bit like mushroom, so be careful not to get the two confused."
