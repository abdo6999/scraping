    "description": "Climate is a compound sign. First, sign weather, then sign tendency. To sign weather, form both hands into the ASL letter W sign as you make them face each other in front of you. Then shimmy your 'W' hands down a few inches in alternating directions, followed by making the 'tendency' sign with your dominant hand.\nTo sign tendency, hold your dominant hand wide open, extend the middle finger forward, then flick it forward from your dominant shoulder."
