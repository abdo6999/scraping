    "word": "Cry",
    "description": "Cry is signed by looking sad and tracing imaginary tears down your face using your index fingers. Start with your dominant index finger extended just below your eye, and move the index finger down your face. Alternate with the other index finger on the opposite cheek. Move your index fingers up and down your cheeks in alternating or simultaneous motions, making your face look unhappy so that your baby understands the meaning."
