    "word": "Cherry",
    "description": "Cherry in sign language looks like your are outlining a cherry on a stem. Extend your pinkie from your non-dominant hand, to make the stem of a cherry. Then take the fingers from your dominant hand and place them around the end of the non-dominant pinkie, twisting the fingers around.\nNote that cherry is slightly different from berry in ASL, where the latter is signed by wrapping your dominant fingers around the non-dominant index or pointer finger."
