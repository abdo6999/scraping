    "word": "Crab",
    "description": "Crab in sign language looks like the claws of a crab opening and closing. Take both hands and touch your thumbs to your fingers to form a claw, then open and close your claws. An alternative ASL sign for crab is to take just the pointer or index fingers and touch them with the thumbs multiple times."
