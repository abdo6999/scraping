    "word": "Check",
    "description": "Check is signed just a bit like bill, so be careful not to get the two confused.\nTo sign check, hold your non-dominant hand open and horizontally before you, palm facing in and thumb sticking up. Then take your dominant hand, form it into the ASL letter C hand, and use it to grasp your non-dominant hand, starting from the curve at the base of the thumb and sliding to the edge of the index finger. It is like you are tracing the top and bottom edges of a check."
